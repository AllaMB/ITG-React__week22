      "info": "In terms of popularity, the Dark Knight can only be compared to Superman. His image seems very mystical and dark: a black suit with a flowing cape, the intimidating Batmobile, headquarters in a damp cave. His biography is as dark as his image. In his childhood, he witnessed the murder of his parents, and young Bruce vowed to protect his native Gotham from crime with all his might. Despite his old age, Bruce is famous; the first issue featuring him was released in 1939. With each passing year, his popularity only grows, thanks in part to adaptations such as 'The Dark Knight,' the 'Gotham' series, and several films with the same name. The main reason for such love among fans is the idea that anyone can become Batman. If you think about it, he is one of the few heroes who achieved his position through intelligence and determination rather than mutations."

        "info": "The complete opposite of his adversary Batman. If Bruce Wayne was a regular person who became a hero, Superman was born a hero but had to portray himself as coming from a poor Kansas family. The last survivor of the planet Krypton was sent to Earth just before his home was destroyed. Superman is a chameleon of the comic book world. In his first appearance in 1938, he was just a muscle-bound man who could break walls and knock down doors. Later, his abilities included the power of flight. In various incarnations of Clark, from a teenager in 'Smallville' to the majestic 'Man of Steel,' there are different levels and quantities of superpowers. His vulnerability to Kryptonite, a radioactive substance from his home planet, remains unchanged."

        "info": "Arguably the most popular modern superhero. He shares a lot with the dark knight Batman: both lost their parents in childhood, became crime fighters without special superpowers, and are incredibly wealthy. However, while Batman is admired, Tony Stark is adored :) Perhaps it's due to Robert Downey Jr.'s fantastic acting, who secured the role over Nicolas Cage and Tom Cruise, or maybe it's the well-developed character. The inspiration for the character came from Elon Musk and inventor Howard Hughes. Iron Man didn't always wear a red fashionable suit: in its early versions in 1963, it was a modest gray color. Unfortunately, in the cinematic representation, the armored suit is not even made of metal - it is made of plastic and fiberglass."

        "info": "Spider-Man was born out of Marvel Comics' need to create a teenage hero. Other superheroes like Batman and Superman were adult men, and the target audience didn't see them as role models. Fifteen-year-old Peter Parker showed all Earth teenagers that you can both defeat villains and marry a beauty, and you don't even have to be super handsome! You just need a spider bite :) Peter didn't immediately use his powers for good; initially, he wanted to make money by participating in illegal no-rules fights. Then his beloved Uncle Ben died at the hands of a robber, and the teenager vowed to rid his hometown of New York of evil. However, over time, he realized that one vow was not enough and that 'with great power comes great responsibility.' By the way, not all of Peter's superpowers came from mutation: the guy independently hacked into Tony Stark's technology, earning his recognition."

            "info": "Captain America is a character created specifically to embody the ideals of patriotism. Therefore, he was particularly popular during World War II. In comics, the term 'Captain America' is applied to anyone chosen by the U.S. government. However, it became most associated with Steve Rogers. Steve was born in 1917 to Irish immigrants Sarah and Joseph Rogers. In his childhood, he was a very weak boy and constantly subjected to ridicule from other kids. Due to his Irish roots, the guy didn't engage in fights. At the beginning of World War II, Steve wanted to join the front, but he was rejected due to his health. By fate, he was offered to participate in a secret defense project aimed at creating a super-soldier. Despite difficulties during the experiment, the result was successful. Rogers transformed from a weak boy into a true Apollo. Actor Chris Evans handled this role quite well :)"

            "info": "The character of Thor is based on the Norse god of the same name. In the Marvel universe, Thor is the natural son of Odin and the ancient goddess Gaea. After his birth, Odin took him to Asgard, where he was raised with his wife, the goddess Frigg. Thor always considered Frigg his true mother and only learned the truth about his birth much later. It's worth mentioning that before the current Thor played by Chris Hemsworth, there were several incarnations of the superhero. In one of them, he died in a battle with the mythical serpent Midgard. This led to Ragnarok - a kind of apocalypse in Norse mythology."

            "info": "The idea of creating Hulk as a character can be traced back to the novella 'Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde,' where a scientist cannot reconcile with his demonic alter ego. Hulk's past is as bad as it gets: Bruce's father suffered from alcoholism and bouts of rage, and his mother tried desperately to protect her son from her husband's anger. She died defending her only child from his beatings. Carrying a heavy psychological burden throughout his childhood, Bruce grew into an extremely gifted but introverted young man. Although Bruce couldn't respect his father, he followed in his footsteps in science, choosing nuclear physics. During an experiment, he injected himself with a test serum and exposed himself to a large amount of gamma radiation. Banner transformed into an uncontrollable giant who crushed everything around and didn't understand what was happening. The name Hulk became synonymous with people who cannot control themselves."

Her real name, Diana, was given in honor of the ancient Greek goddess of hunting, and her superpowers came from the goddess of love, Aphrodite. Diana was raised in an exclusively female society, so Wonder Woman often appears in culture as a symbol of feminism. Diana has super equipment: the Lasso of Truth and a tiara. The first was forged by the god of fire, Hephaestus, and it never misses. A person caught in its loop will inevitably tell their secrets, remember forgotten things, and even obey orders. The tiara works as a throwing weapon capable of cutting anything. The crown with a star in the center symbolizes the patriotism of the American heroine and serves as a stylish accessory :)"

Growing up, Natasha joined the 'Red Room' organization, where she underwent numerous trainings as part of a spy program. There, she was injected with a Super-Soldier serum, similar to Captain America's but in the Soviet version. Thanks to it, Natasha can use the maximum capabilities of her body: strength, flexibility, speed, agility, etc. The serum also provides the effect of slowed aging. According to fans, Black Widow's most significant advantage is that she was played by the beauty Scarlett Johansson :)"

What remained unchanged is his cynical, dark sense of humor, earning him the nickname 'The Merc with a Mouth."
